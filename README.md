Try and edit this
 Dear Andy,
 This is how I did
 I create a new branch from you project
 I use Github Desktop, I cloned your repository from the branch I created (Choose "Open in Desktop" when you clone)
 Github Desktop asked me to choose a folder to contain your repository
 I create a new folder and every file in your repository downloaded to my local machine (my laptop)
 Now I work on my local machine, make some changes and commit those changes. And then pull request to your repository.
 Best regards,
 Linh
